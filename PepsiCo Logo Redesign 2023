🎯 Pepsi is a brand that has been a part of our lives for over a century. In 2023, something big happened — Pepsi changed its logo for the first time in more than 10 years. This wasn’t just a design change. It was a story of how data and design can work together to connect the past, present, and future of a brand.

📖 A Century-Old Brand with a Modern Challenge
Pepsi’s journey began in the 1890s when it was first called Brad’s Drink, created by Caleb Bradham. Over the years, it became one of the most recognized soda brands in the world. But staying relevant is not easy — especially in today’s fast-moving digital world.
In 2023, to celebrate its 125th anniversary, Pepsi introduced a new logo. This was not just about giving the brand a new look. It was about making the brand feel fresh again while still respecting its rich history. The goal was to create something that feels modern, but still familiar to people who grew up with Pepsi.



🔬 Researching What People Really Feel
Before launching the new design, Pepsi didn’t just guess what would work. They invested in consumer research using a tool called QuestBrand by The Harris Poll. This tool is known for providing real-time insights by surveying thousands of people every day. It helps brands understand how people feel, think, and respond to them.
Pepsi discovered something very interesting from this research. Consumers had strong emotional connections with the Pepsi logos from the 1970s and 1980s. Many people also felt that the “Pepsi” name should appear inside the circular globe logo instead of below it, which is how it looked in the 2008 version. These findings became the foundation for Pepsi’s design team to start creating a new logo.

✍️ How the Survey Was Done
The research was conducted online across the United States from January 1 to September 30, 2023. In total, 5,743 U.S. adults participated in this survey. This large sample helped ensure the results reflected the opinions of a wide range of people.
The survey measured different brand metrics such as familiarity, quality, purchase consideration, emotional feelings, and how likely someone was to recommend Pepsi to others. These are important parts of something called “brand equity,” which tells a company how strong or valuable their brand is in the minds of customers.
This data gave Pepsi the confidence to move forward with a bold new design, knowing what their customers actually wanted.

🎨 The Logo Makeover – From Old to Bold
In August 2023, Pepsi began rolling out the new logo in the U.S. (with a global rollout planned in 2024). The difference between the old and new logo is clear and exciting.
The 2008 logo used soft colors, and the word "pepsi" appeared in small, lowercase letters under the globe, which had a tilted white stripe.
The 2023 logo, however, is a throwback to the classic 1973 design, but with a modern twist. The colors are brighter and bolder. The word “PEPSI” is written in large uppercase letters and placed inside the globe — just as the research suggested. The white stripe is now centered instead of tilted. And there's a black outline, which also connects to Pepsi’s increasing focus on zero-sugar products.
This redesign is more than just a visual upgrade — it is a powerful symbol of Pepsi’s ability to listen, evolve, and stay connected to its audience.



📈 Results That Speak for Themselves
After the new logo was announced, Pepsi’s performance began to improve. Using QuestBrand data, Pepsi’s brand momentum — which means how strongly the brand is competing and growing in the market — increased from 32.0 in early June to 39.6 by early September. That’s a jump of +7.6 points over a few months.
Not just that — the number of people who said they would recommend Pepsi to others also grew. At the start of 2023, Pepsi had a recommend score of 36.4, but this rose to 42.7 by September, an increase of +6.3 points. This is a big sign of brand love — it means that not only are people happy with the product, but they’re excited enough to tell others about it.
This shows that the redesign worked — not only in how it looked but also in how it made people feel.
